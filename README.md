# Synthetic Control Example  
This project demonstrates how I would approach using **synthetic control methods** to evaluate the impact of promotions, feature launches, or policy changes in the sports betting industry.  

Sports betting in the U.S. is largely regulated at the **state level**. As more states legalize sports betting and adopt varying regulations, companies need **robust ways to assess how these changes affect user engagement, revenue, and market dynamics**.  In addition to regulatory variation, **sports fandom is heavily shaped by state-level factors**, including home team effects and regional preferences, leading to the need for state-level strategies to promotions and feature launch. 

I [created hypothetical data](https://github.com/changkimberlee/Portfolio-Synthetic-Control/blob/main/synthetic_control_data.ipynb) of betting activities (volume) in four states (NJ, PA, MI and IL) as well as state-level features such as Population, Median_Income, Unemployment_Rate, Regulatory_Strictness, Population_Conservativeness, Sports_Popularity_Index and Home_Team_Historical_Winrate. I created a daily panel from 2022-01-01 to 2023-06-30. I assume that there was a promotion launched 2023-03-01 only targeted to users in New Jersey. I was to assess the impact of this promotion on Bet Volume in New Jersey, using the synthetic control approach. 

[Here](https://github.com/changkimberlee/Portfolio-Synthetic-Control/blob/main/synthetic_control_model.ipynb) is my code for 1. **Creating the synthetic control** using ridge regression (with cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning)
; 2. **Assessing pre-treatment balance** of bet volume and state-level features between actual and synthetic units; 3. **Assessing and plotting short- and long-term ATT and cumulative effects**

This is an illustration of the hypothetical/synthetic panel of betting volume that I created:

## The Challenge: Causal Inference at the State Level  
Causal inference at the state level is critical for sports betting companies to make informed decisions about:  
- Where and how to allocate marketing resources. How to design state-specific promotions
- How the market will respond to market entrances
- How to anticipate the effects of regulatory changes  

However, identifying the true **causal impact** of a policy or feature in a specific state is challenging because:  

- **No clear counterfactuals** â€” we cannot observe what would have happened if the policy or feature had not been introduced.
- **States differ in many ways**, including demographics, sports fandom intensity, and regulatory environments, making choosing a "control" state impossible and making simple comparisons misleading.  
- **Time trends vary across states**, so naive before-and-after comparisons risk conflating underlying trends with actual intervention effects.
- - **Limited and low number of states** for statistical inferences. 

## The Synthetic Control Solution  
**Synthetic control** offers a principled way to construct a **counterfactual** for a treated state by creating a weighted combination of other states that did **not** experience the policy or feature launch. These weights are chosen so that, **prior to the intervention**, the synthetic version of the treated state closely mirrors its outcomes and relevant predictors (e.g., sports betting activity, demographics, team presence).  

By comparing the **actual post-intervention outcomes** in the treated state to the **synthetic control**, we can estimate the **causal effect** of the policy or feature.  

**Synthetic control is especially useful when**:  
- Randomized experiments are not feasible  
- The number of units (states) is limited  
- Treatment is implemented at the aggregate (state) level
  
Making synthetic control the appropriate solution to these cases in the sports betting industry. 

## Leveraging Political Science for Synthetic Control  
In general, my Political Science training grounds my approach to synthetic control. **Political science literature, datasets, and methodological innovations** has led the development and application of synthetic control methods in U.S. state-level policy evaluation.  Political scientists have used synthetic control to study the impact of diverse state-level policies, including:  
- Economic policies (e.g., minimum wage increases)  
- Public health interventions (e.g., tobacco control laws)  
- Criminal justice reforms (e.g., sentencing policy changes)  
- Voting laws (e.g., voter ID legislation)  

These studies often grapple with the same issues of **state heterogeneity, limited units, and staggered policy adoption** that also characterize the sports betting industry.  By grounding my synthetic control approach in this well-established body of political science research, I bring a **rigorous, tested methodology** to sports betting analytics. 

### State-Level Panel Datasets Available
To build credible and rich pre-treatment models, we can use **state-level panel datasets**, some frequently used in political science research. I provide some resources here:
